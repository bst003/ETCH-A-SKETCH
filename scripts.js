PLANNING

Increment opacity of background by .1 for each pass over?

The sidebar will contain all of the controls
    - Button for black mode (selected by default)
    - Button for rainbow mode
    - Button for eraser mode
    - Range input for determing board size (16 block min, 100 block max)
        - Add note to notify user that board will clear if board size is changed
    - Button to clear the board

#eas-board will be the container for the etch-a-sketch
    - Will get value of range input to determine size
    - Will use display grid to align the divs inside
